# FAULT-ATTACK-ON-ROADRUNNER-BLOCK-CIPHER
◦ Objective : Implementation and Fault Attack on RoadRunneR block cipher
◦ In fault attack we have to find the equations before and after injecting fault in last round.
◦ RoadRunneR is a lightweight block cipher in which there is 10 rounds and key size is 80 and 128.
◦ To solve an equation in such a way so that we can find round key in more efficient way.
◦ In this project we had implemented the RoadRunneR Block Cipher and prove that the no. of equations is less then no. of Variables    for finding the roundkey.
